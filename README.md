Diamond Valuation Project

Project objectives:
Create a platform that helps customers value diamonds quickly and accurately, through online self-assessment or in-store valuation methods.

Valuation Form:
1. Seller Determines Price Through Website: The seller can assess the value of the diamond at home, based on the information available on the website. In this way, they can calculate and determine the value of the diamond themselves and determine the value of the diamond.

2. Seller Comes to Store to Set Price Sellers can come to the store themselves for appraisal. At the store, appraisers will examine diamonds based on professional criteria and provide valuation results directly to customers.

This project aims to provide a modern and convenient solution for diamond valuation, to create trust and satisfaction from customers.
